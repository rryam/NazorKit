# NazorKit

NazorKit is a library built on top of MLX-Swift to easily integrate on-device vision language models into your iOS app. 

The name "Nazor" is inspired by the Persian word "نظر" - "nazar" meaning vision/sight/gaze). While the traditional spelling is "nazar," I chose the variant "nazor" to create a unique name while maintaining its connection to the Persian heritage of visual perception.
